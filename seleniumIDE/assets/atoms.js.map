The constructor intentionally takes no parameters and the type\n * is immutable; hence only a default instance corresponding to the empty string\n * can be obtained via constructor invocation.\n *\n * A SafeStyle's string representation ({@link #getTypedStringValue()}) can\n * safely:\n * <ul>\n *   <li>Be interpolated as the entire content of a *quoted* HTML style\n *       attribute, or before already existing properties. The SafeStyle string\n *       *must be HTML-attribute-escaped* (where \" and ' are escaped) before\n *       interpolation.\n *   <li>Be interpolated as the entire content of a {}-wrapped block within a\n *       stylesheet, or before already existing properties. The SafeStyle string\n *       should not be escaped before interpolation. SafeStyle's contract also\n *       guarantees that the string will not be able to introduce new properties\n *       or elide existing ones.\n *   <li>Be assigned to the style property of a DOM node. The SafeStyle string\n *       should not be escaped before being assigned to the property.\n * </ul>\n *\n * A SafeStyle may never contain literal angle brackets. Otherwise, it could\n * be unsafe to place a SafeStyle into a &lt;style&gt; tag (where it can't\n * be HTML escaped). For example, if the SafeStyle containing\n * \"{@code font: 'foo &lt;style/&gt;&lt;script&gt;evil&lt;/script&gt;'}\" were\n * interpolated within a &lt;style&gt; tag, this would then break out of the\n * style context into HTML.\n *\n * A SafeStyle may contain literal single or double quotes, and as such the\n * entire style string must be escaped when used in a style attribute (if\n * this were not the case, the string could contain a matching quote that\n * would escape from the style attribute).\n *\n * Values of this type must be composable, i.e. for any two values\n * {@code style1} and {@code style2} of this type,\n * {@code goog.html.SafeStyle.unwrap(style1) +\n * goog.html.SafeStyle.unwrap(style2)} must itself be a value that satisfies\n * the SafeStyle type constraint. This requirement implies that for any value\n * {@code style} of this type, {@code goog.html.SafeStyle.unwrap(style)} must\n * not end in a \"property value\" or \"property name\" context. For example,\n * a value of {@code background:url(\"} or {@code font-} would not satisfy the\n * SafeStyle contract. This is because concatenating such strings with a\n * second value that itself does not contain unsafe CSS can result in an\n * overall string that does. For example, if {@code javascript:evil())\"} is\n * appended to {@code background:url(\"}, the resulting string may result in\n * the execution of a malicious script.\n *\n * TODO(mlourenco): Consider whether we should implement UTF-8 interchange\n * validity checks and blacklisting of newlines (including Unicode ones) and\n * other whitespace characters (\\t, \\f).

New code\n * should construct goog.html types via their APIs, template systems or\n * sanitizers. If that’s not possible it should use\n * goog.html.uncheckedconversions and undergo security review.\n\n *\n * The semantics of the conversions in goog.html.legacyconversions are very\n * different from the ones provided by goog.html.uncheckedconversions. The\n * latter are for use in code where it has been established through manual\n * security review that the value produced by a piece of code will always\n * satisfy the SafeHtml contract (e.g., the output of a secure HTML sanitizer).\n * In uses of goog.html.legacyconversions, this guarantee is not given -- the\n * value in question originates in unreviewed legacy code and there is no\n * guarantee that it satisfies the SafeHtml contract.\n *\n * There are only three valid uses of legacyconversions:\n *\n * 1. Introducing a goog.html version of a function which currently consumes\n * string and passes that string to a DOM API which can execute script - and\n * hence cause XSS - like innerHTML. For example, Dialog might expose a\n * setContent method which takes a string and sets the innerHTML property of\n * an element with it. In this case a setSafeHtmlContent function could be\n * added, consuming goog.html.SafeHtml instead of string, and using\n * goog.dom.safe.setInnerHtml instead of directly setting innerHTML.\n * setContent could then internally use legacyconversions to create a SafeHtml\n * from string and pass the SafeHtml to setSafeHtmlContent. In this scenario\n * remember to document the use of legacyconversions in the modified setContent\n * and consider deprecating it as well.\n *\n * 2. Automated refactoring of application code which handles HTML as string\n * but needs to call a function which only takes goog.html types. For example,\n * in the Dialog scenario from (1) an alternative option would be to refactor\n * setContent to accept goog.html.SafeHtml instead of string and then refactor\n * all current callers to use legacyconversions to pass SafeHtml. This is\n * generally preferable to (1) because it keeps the library clean of\n * legacyconversions, and makes code sites in application code that are\n * potentially vulnerable to XSS more apparent.\n *\n * 3. Old code which needs to call APIs which consume goog.html types and for\n * which it is prohibitively expensive to refactor to use goog.html types.\n * Generally, this is code where safety from XSS is either hopeless or\n * unimportant.\n *\n * @visibility {//closure/goog/html:approved_for_legacy_conversion}\n * @visibility {//closure/goog/bin/sizetests:__pkg__}\n */\n\n\n\n\ngoog.html.SafeHtml=require(\"./safehtml.js\").goog.html.SafeHtml;\ngoog.html.SafeStyle=require(\"./safestyle.js\").goog.html.SafeStyle;\ngoog.html.SafeStyleSheet=require(\"./safestylesheet.js\").goog.html.SafeStyleSheet;\ngoog.html.SafeUrl=require(\"./safeurl.js\").goog.html.SafeUrl;\ngoog.html.TrustedResourceUrl=require(\"./trustedresourceurl.js\").goog.html.TrustedResourceUrl;\n\n\n/**\n * Performs an \"unchecked conversion\" from string to SafeHtml for legacy API\n * purposes.\n *\n * Please read fileoverview documentation before using.\n *\n * @param {string} html A string to be converted to SafeHtml.\n * @return {!goog.html.SafeHtml} The value of html, wrapped in a SafeHtml\n *     object.\n */\ngoog.html.legacyconversions.safeHtmlFromString = function(html) {\n  goog.html.legacyconversions.reportCallback_();\n  return goog.html.SafeHtml.createSafeHtmlSecurityPrivateDoNotAccessOrElse(\n      html, null /* dir */);\n};\n\n\n/**\n * Performs an \"unchecked conversion\" from string to SafeStyle for legacy API\n * purposes.\n *\n * Please read fileoverview documentation before using.\n *\n * @param {string} style A string to be converted to SafeStyle.\n * @return {!goog.html.SafeStyle} The value of style, wrapped in a SafeStyle\n *     object.\n */\ngoog.html.legacyconversions.safeStyleFromString = function(style) {\n  goog.html.legacyconversions.reportCallback_();\n  return goog.html.SafeStyle.createSafeStyleSecurityPrivateDoNotAccessOrElse(\n      style);\n};\n\n\n/**\n * Performs an \"unchecked conversion\" from string to SafeStyleSheet for legacy\n * API purposes.\n *\n * Please read fileoverview documentation before using.\n *\n * @param {string} styleSheet A string to be converted to SafeStyleSheet.\n * @return {!goog.html.SafeStyleSheet} The value of style sheet, wrapped in\n *     a SafeStyleSheet object.\n */\ngoog.html.legacyconversions.safeStyleSheetFromString = function(styleSheet) {\n  goog.html.legacyconversions.reportCallback_();\n  return goog.html.SafeStyleSheet\n      .createSafeStyleSheetSecurityPrivateDoNotAccessOrElse(styleSheet);\n};\n\n\n/**\n * Performs an \"unchecked conversion\" from string to SafeUrl for legacy API\n * purposes.\n *\n * Please read fileoverview documentation before using.\n *\n * @param {string} url A string to be converted to SafeUrl.\n * @return {!goog.html.SafeUrl} The value of url, wrapped in a SafeUrl\n *     object.\n */\ngoog.html.legacyconversions.safeUrlFromString = function(url) {\n  goog.html.legacyconversions.reportCallback_();\n  return goog.html.SafeUrl.createSafeUrlSecurityPrivateDoNotAccessOrElse(url);\n};\n\n\n/**\n * Performs an \"unchecked conversion\" from string to TrustedResourceUrl for\n * legacy API purposes.\n *\n * Please read fileoverview documentation before using.\n *\n * @param {string} url A string to be converted to TrustedResourceUrl.\n * @return {!goog.html.TrustedResourceUrl} The value of url, wrapped in a\n *     TrustedResourceUrl object.\n */\ngoog.html.legacyconversions.trustedResourceUrlFromString = function(url) {\n  goog.html.legacyconversions.reportCallback_();\n  return goog.html.TrustedResourceUrl\n      .createTrustedResourceUrlSecurityPrivateDoNotAccessOrElse(url);\n};\n\n/**\n * @private {function(): undefined}\n */\ngoog.html.legacyconversions.reportCallback_ = goog.nullFunction;\n\n\n/**\n * Sets a function that will be called every time a legacy conversion is\n * performed.
